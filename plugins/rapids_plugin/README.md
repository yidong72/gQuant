## gQuant RAPIDS Plugin Example
This is a example to show how to write an external gQuant RAPIDS plugin. gQuant take advantage of the `entry point` inside the `setup.py` file to register the plugin. gQuant can discover all the plugins that has the entry point group name `gquant.plugin`. Check the `setup.py` file to see details.

The examples range from simple accelerated calculation of technical trading indicators through defining workflows for interactively developing trading strategies and automating many typical tasks.

The extensibility of the system is highlighted by examples showing how to create a dataframe flow graph, which allows for easy re-use and composability of higher level workflows.

The examples also show how to easily convert a single-threaded solution into a Dask distributed one. 

These examples can be used as-is or, as they are open source, can be extended to suit your environments.

### Create an new Python enviroment
```bash
conda create -n test python=3.8
```

### Prerequisites
- NVIDIA Pascalâ„¢ GPU architecture or better.
- [CUDA 9.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-92-download-archive) with driver v396.37+ or [CUDA 10.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive) with driver v410.48+.
- Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04.
- [NVIDIA-docker v2+](https://github.com/nvidia/nvidia-docker/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-do-i-install-20-if-im-not-using-the-latest-docker-version).


### Download data files

Run the following command at the project root diretory 
```bash
bash download_data.sh

```

### Install the gQuant 
To install the gQuant graph computation library, first install the dependence libraries:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge dask networkx python-graphviz ruamel.yaml pandas pydot
```

Then install `gquant`:
```bash
pip install gquant
```
Or install `gquant` at the gQuant directory:
```bash
pip install .
```

### Install the gquantlab JupyterLab plugin
To install `gquantlab` JupyterLab plugin, install the following dependence libraries:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets nodejs=12.4.0
```
Then install the `gquantlab`:
```bash
pip install gquantlab
```
Or install `gquantlab` at the gquantlab directory:
```bash
pip install .
```

### Install the external example plugin
```
conda install -y -c rapidsai -c nvidia -c conda-forge -c defaults rapids=0.17
conda install -c conda-forge yarn pytables
pip install git+https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot.git@master
pip install ray[tune]
```
To install the external plugin, in the plugin diretory, run following command
```bash
pip install .
```

### Launch the Jupyter lab
After launching the JupyterLab by,
```bash
jupyter-lab --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --NotebookApp.token=''
```
